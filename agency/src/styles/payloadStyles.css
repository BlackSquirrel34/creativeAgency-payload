/* This is a more advanced way to import TailwindCSS. 
It gives us the option to comment out the base layer and preflight to make it 
work with Payload. So it pretty much replaces the one-liner (@import "tailwindcss";), 
which we can then copy and use in globals.css for the frontend. */

/* Define the Tailwind layers in the correct order */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

/* Import the Tailwind theme styles */
@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);

/* Skip the preflight reset to avoid conflicts with Payload's admin styles */
/* @import 'tailwindcss/preflight.css' layer(base); */

/* Import Tailwind utilities */
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);

/* Payload uses a data-theme="dark" attribute rather than relying on browser settings. */
/* Support Payloadâ€™s dark mode toggle by adding a custom variant */
/* @custom-variant dark (&:where([data-theme=dark], [data-theme=dark] *)); */
